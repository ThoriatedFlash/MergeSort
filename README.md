  This mergesort test program will generate an int array containing a random
  number of elements and random values. The array is then sorted using mergesort
  and the sorted array is displayed. There is a REPEAT flag that can also be set
  in order to run the test in an infinite loop.
  
  This implementation was based on the tutorial found at
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/
